suite of applications powered by aetion evidence platform\u00ae, are scientifically validated software that analyze data from the real world to produce transparent and rapid answers on safety and effectiveness. the aetion suite is used worldwide to generate reliable rwe for life sciences companies, academia, payers, and regulators. the software provides guardrails to apply principled database epidemiology and enables transparent longitudinal analyses\u2014essential to inferring causality.  the suite of applications powered by aetion evidence platform was created in response to a need identified by two harvard data scientists: a platform that could automate causal analytics in real-world data (rwd) at the highest level of scientific rigor. the scientific validity of the platform is reflective of the decades of experience at harvard medical school of aetion's co-founders, dr. sebastian schneeweiss and dr. jeremy rassen, where they used a wide variety of rwd sources to answer the most critical and complex questions about populations, diseases, and therapies. studies completed using aetion evidence platform are scientifically valid, reproducible, and fully transparent for

well-established relationship with the fda\u2014demonstrated by engagements including the rct-duplicate demonstration (2019-22), and further strengthened by a multi-year research collaboration established in 2020 (including rwe generation focused on safety matters). most recently, aetion began a five-year research collaboration with the fda oncology center of excellence to advance research using novel oncology rwd sources via aetion substantiate. the collaboration will use our platform and suite of applications to identify and analyze fit-for-purpose rwd sources to address key research questions that are relevant to prevention, clinical care, diagnostics, and treatment in oncology. similarly, ema selected aetion in 2021 for a four-year partnership supporting ema decision-making in europe via real-world research and evidence generation to help assess the safety and efficacy of medicines. further, as a european network of centres for pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacovigilance (encepp) designated research centre since 2020, aetion is performing ema-certified rwe studies and contributing to encepp working groups 2 and 3, whose focus is \u201cindependence and transparency\u201d in rwe research and to inventory eu data sources and define methodological approaches for multi-database studies, respectively.  brigham and women's hospital used aetion evidence platform to build a federated data network to efficiently and reliably confirm or refute signals on hundreds of new uses for more than 700 fda-approved drugs with rwd analyses. further, the fda has partnered with aetion to leverage the consistency and reliability of substantiate in producing regulatory grade, transparent analytics to study treatments for covid-19.  aetion's technology is also at work in the repeat initiative, a program to improve transparency and quality of rwd analyses. guided by members of the fda, ema, and pharmaceuticals & medical devices agency of japan, repeat

payers, providers, and other stakeholders. 2.1.2 analytics engine aetion evidence platform's high-throughput architecture supports execution, reporting, and archiving of rwd/e/i analytic workflows. meta-analysis across studies allows for one statistically validated global result across all data sets used. \u25cf scientifically validated analytic workflows. aep's analytic workflows span exploratory analyses to generate hypotheses, descriptive and predictive analyses to test hypotheses, and causal and federated analyses. these templates can be applied with minimal modifications in other datasets, ensuring a consistent analytical approach. all analyses offer extensive subgrouping, including by patient characteristics, comorbidities, and other factors.  \u25cf transparent and auditable environment. real-world evidence must be transparent and reproducible. any data transformations and methodological decisions made in an analysis with aep are fully and automatically documented, reducing administrative burden and avoiding errors introduced via manual processes. aep's audit trail maintains study version summaries, including variable, cohort, and analysis selections. all archived documentation is stored in complete, readable form, and conforms to standards set by organizations such as ispe and ispor.  2.1.3 knowledge management   core to the philosophy of aetion is helping organizations build and retain institutional knowledge of rwe. with aep's library and archiving capabilities, we facilitate collaboration among and across teams, bridging a collective understanding of and role-appropriate access to study designs, cohort, exposure and outcome definitions/measures, and analytic approaches. the platform also allows browsing through the catalog of databases available for analysis. databases can be quickly and easily assessed for analysis feasibility by demographic characteristics and time criteria, as well as by disease prevalence/incidence. summary statistics plus relevant details (e.g., update date) are shown by default.   more specifically, features supporting this capability include the following: \u25cf dataset

snapshot of all available datasets on aep, and it contains information about the number of patients, the data range, and the date of last update. \u25cf measure library. aep contains a repository of thousands public measures that can be used across projects. these pre-defined measures are applicable to major datasets, encapsulating disease-specific measurements (e.g., comorbidity scores and fda health outcomes of interest), common procedures, common medications, health and lifestyle factors, cost, resource utilization, and disease risk. the measure library displays information about the type of measure, when it was last modified, and with what dataset it was built. from the library, measures can be copied into personal projects. the measure library promotes ease of use across teams by eliminating the need to duplicate the same measure definition. when applied in analyses, measures trigger the inclusion of relevant citations in output reports. measures allow the user to work with on-platform data in an efficient, traceable, and reproducible way. \u25cf project library. projects in aep provide the structure for implementing a pharmacoepidemiological study. a project contains the measures, cohorts, and analysis plans necessary for completing a study. the project library is a resource of all projects in aep with information on when they were last modified. \u25cf cohort library. the cohort library is a repository for cohorts across projects at aetion. the cohort library enables collaboration and consistency of cohort definitions across internal stakeholders. 2.1.4 compliance and entitlements  through any workflow, from cohort creation to reports and dashboard functionalities, aep's targeted user-level permissions enable a variety of user profiles (e.g., evidence creators versus consumers) to access the information in a fully governed, auditable, and transparent environment. aep offers extensive access controls to allow for the appropriate combination of (a) users, (b) projects, (c) data assets, (d) analysis workflows, and (e) execution ability (view only, edit, execute). permissions can be applied at the system, project, or user level and can be grouped into configurable roles for ease of application. aep also offers extensive logging and audit capability for system management and compliance purposes.   aetion evidence platform is the

analysis/refreshed analyses,  and enable reproducibility in other datasets. substantiate's cohort explorer displays a random sample of 10 patients to quickly understand a convenience sample of individual patient timelines. patients can be characterized and stratified by event details such as the primary diagnosis or days supplied. \u25cf pre-built and customizable measures. the building

(e.g., comparative safety analysis or comparative effectiveness analysis) executed on substantiate to define key parts of the subsequent analytic approach for pooled data, such as the effects estimate type and adjustment for population overlap. the effects estimate types that can be specified include risk ratio/odds ratio, risk difference, rate ratio, rate difference, and difference in means. both
