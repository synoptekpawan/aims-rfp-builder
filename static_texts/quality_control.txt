Security and Compliance
Synoptek maintains industry-standard corporate security controls.  The measures we follow have been independently evaluated for their presence and continuity through the American Institute of CPAsâ€™ Report on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security and Availability (commonly referred to as a SOC 2 Type II attestation report), and from an ISO/IEC27001:2013 (Information Technology - Security Techniques - Information Security Management Systems) Certification.  These independent attestations and certifications provide clients with proof that Synoptek continues to maintain a reasonable level of control over client data. The reports are available upon request.
