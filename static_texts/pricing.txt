Synoptek believes in transparent and straightforward pricing structures that align with your specific needs and budgetary considerations.  Our Engineering Center of Excellence pricing model is meticulously designed to provide clarity on fee structures, markups, and any supplementary costs, ensuring that you have a comprehensive understanding of the investment involved.  We prioritize transparency in our pricing, and for your convenience, any region/country-specific pricing is converted to United States dollars (USD), with a clear delineation of any underlying assumptions related to weekly, monthly, or fixed pricing options.

a)	Base Salary
The foundation of our pricing structure is the base salary, which constitutes the core remuneration for our dedicated team members at the Engineering Center of Excellence.  The base salary is determined based on the position, skills, and experience of the team members and reflects competitive market rates in the offshore location.  This component ensures that our team members receive competitive compensation while still offering cost advantages compared to hiring in high-cost regions.

b)	Loading Factors
In addition to the base salary, we incorporate a loading factor to account for other employee-related costs, such as statutory benefits, insurance, HR management, legal compliance, infrastructure, technology support, and overall coordination and administrative expenses. For a few items, this loading factor is expressed as a percentage of the base salary and varies according to local regulations and practices.  It ensures that all statutory and operational requirements are met, providing a comprehensive compensation package for our team members.  It is designed to ensure the seamless functioning of the offshore subsidiary, with transparent management practices that align with the parent company's objectives.  Loading Factors would likely vary based on the location of the ECE.

c)	Shift Charges
Shift charges are fees or costs for working beyond the team’s standard shift which for India, for example, is (10 AM to 7 PM).  These charges help us to incentivize the team to work in off-peak periods and provide our customers with overlapping working hours. Shift charges could vary based on the location of the ECE.

d)	Total Cost Calculation
The total cost for services provided by the ECE is calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Base Salary + (Base Salary x Loading Factors) + Shift Charges

The combination of these components results in a predictable and comprehensive pricing structure.  The base salary and loading factor represent the remuneration for our skilled team members, while the management fee covers the costs associated with efficient operations and management of the ECE.  This pricing structure enables our clients to have a clear understanding of their financial commitments and the value they receive.

•	Cost Transparency and Benefits: Transparency is a core principle of our pricing structure. It allows our clients to see the breakdown of costs and understand how each component contributes to the overall pricing. The benefits of this approach include:
•	Clarity: Clients have a clear understanding of the financial commitment and where their funds are allocated.
•	Competitive Advantage: Our competitive pricing, in combination with skilled professionals, provides a substantial cost advantage compared to in-house teams in high-cost regions.
•	Efficient Management: The management fee ensures the ECE operates efficiently, complying with local regulations and industry standards.

This pricing structure reflects our commitment to delivering value, cost-efficiency, and excellence in services through a transparent and balanced approach.

By clearly explaining the pricing structure that incorporates the base salary, loading factor, and shift charges, our clients gain a comprehensive understanding of the costs and services provided by the ECE.  This transparency promotes trust and confidence in the financial arrangements and benefits both the client and us.
